# Project Title

Facial Expression Detection and Object Tracking for Educational AI

## Problem Statement

The problem that this project aims to solve is to develop an AI that can help students in real time, based on facial expression tracking and objects that are present in the webcam, to provide help necessary immediately and also to limit the distractions caused by the objects.

## Data

The data that will be used for this project is a dataset of facial expressions and objects. The dataset should be representative of the students that the AI is targeting.

## Methods

The methods that will be used for this project include:

* Facial expression tracking: This will be used to identify the student's facial expressions.
* Object tracking: This will be used to identify objects that are present in the webcam.
* Machine learning: This will be used to train the AI to identify signs of frustration or confusion, provide personalized feedback, recommend additional resources, and limit distractions.

## Results

The results of this project will be an AI that can help students in real time, based on facial expression tracking and objects that are present in the webcam. The AI will be able to identify signs of frustration or confusion, provide personalized feedback, recommend additional resources, and limit distractions.

## Limitations

The limitations of this project include:

* The accuracy of the AI will depend on the quality of the data that is used to train it.
* The AI may not be able to identify all signs of frustration or confusion.
* The AI may not be able to provide personalized feedback that is appropriate for all students.
* The AI may not be able to recommend additional resources that are relevant to all students.
* The AI may not be able to limit all distractions.

## Future Work

The future work for this project includes:

* Collecting a larger dataset of facial expressions and objects.
* Improving the accuracy of the AI.
* Developing a mobile app or web application to deploy the AI.
* Taking steps to protect the privacy of the students.
